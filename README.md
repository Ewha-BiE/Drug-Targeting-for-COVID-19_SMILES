###This is fine-tuned SCFP model which was modified as suitable for small datasets related to COVID-19.

This model was used to experiment on research papers published in the poster of the KSMCB conference. Since some of the library updates didn't fit with the Chainer library(deep learning framework for chemistry), experiments were conducted in a limited version to solve the library dependence.

The original SCFP model was released by the Keio research team and the original paper is [Convolutional neural network based on SMILES representation of compounds for detecting chemical motif ] (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2523-5)
