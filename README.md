# Drug-Targeting-for-COVID-19_SMILES
This is fine-tuned SCFP model  which was modified as suitable for small datasets and COVID-19.
It was used to conduct experiments on poster papers published in the poster papers of the KSMCB conference. Since some of the library updates didn't fit with the chainer code, experiments were conducted in the library version in a limited version to solve the library dependency.

The original SCFP model was released by keio research team( www.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp/smiles).
